**In this study, we explore how perceptions of different nations change when LLMs are assigned specific nationality personas. We assign 193 different nationality personas (e.g., an American person, an Indian Person) to four LLMs and examine how the LLM perceptions of countries change, and how it contribute to the implicit nationality bias**
